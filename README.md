# To-Do List:

- [ ] Media Queries For All Pages! INCLUDING UI EXAMPLES!
- [x] Add a 'services' page? Maybe too money grabby as prices vary. Could use a 'from $x' method? Either way what would I offer? I'm only really good with static sites. Lists of 1 aren't good to look at.
- [ ] ~~See if Sam wants to make graphic wallpaper for the projects bg~~ He wouldn't do it. ET may help instead
